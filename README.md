# Canvas Project Template

A simple template for fullscreen canvas projects.

## Development

- Run `npm install gulp` upon first downloading the repository.
- Make changes in the `/src` directory and gulp `gulp` to build `/dist/js/script.js` or run `gulp watch` to have it build each time a file is updated in the `/src` directory.
